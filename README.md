## Bunprint ₍ᐢ. .ᐢ₎
Bunprint is a fun, bun-themed personality quiz inspired by the 16 MBTI personality types. Although instead of 16 different bun types, there are 8!

This project came to fruition from the joy and curiosity of my friend group doing various personality quizzes online. I wanted to add a little twist to them and made my own. It allowed me to challenge myself with designing a whole application by myself from start to finish since this project was graphic and design-heavy. The graphics and high-fidelity designs were all done on Sketchbook and Figma while the development end was done with React (TypeScript), Flask (Python) and PostgreSQL.  

## Run application locally (⌐⊙_⊙)
